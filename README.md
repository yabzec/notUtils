## 🏴‍☠️ What is this?

**!Utils** (pronounced *Not Utils*) is a web dashboard designed to fill the existential void of a parked domain. It is a collection of JavaScript micro-tools that solve problems you don't have, creating new problems you didn't want.

No heavy frameworks, no complex builds, just pure **Vanilla JS** and artisanal CSS.

## 🧰 Feature Set

Here is what you will find in the control panel:

### 🔐 Security & Privacy (Questionable)
- **Insecure Password Generator**: Creates "robust" passwords like `admin123456` or sequences of repeated numbers.
- **Silent Observer**: A pair of CSS/JS pupils that follow your mouse cursor. If you leave the window, they start looking around suspiciously and blinking.

### ⚙️ Negative Productivity
- **Lazy Switch**: A switch that turns itself off the moment you try to turn it on (and scolds you if you insist).
- **Corporate Speak**: Generates meaningless management phrases ("Synergize agile frameworks") for your next useless meeting.
- **Universal Translator**: Translates anything into "Cat Language", "Binary", or "Caveman".

### 🧠 Wisdom & AI (Low Budget)
- **Ask the Oracle**: A sarcastic oracle that gives terrible answers to your questions.
- **Budget AI**: An Artificial Intelligence simulator that pretends to calculate the entropy of the universe only to tell you "42" or "I don't feel like it".
- **Useless Facts**: Fetches absolutely irrelevant facts from a remote database.

### 🎭 Entertainment & Discomfort
- **Meme Stealer**: Steals the freshest memes directly from Reddit.
- **GIF Dispenser**: An infinite loop of random GIFs (fetched from Reddit).
- **Free Random Image**: Loads random images from *LoremFlickr* (cats, dogs, flamingos...).
- **Emotional Damage**: An insult generator to lower your self-esteem.
- **Instant Regret**: Generator of "Dad Jokes" (terrible puns).
- **Nerd Humor**: Jokes that only programmers might understand (and maybe not even them).
- **Server Cats (HTTP Cats)**: Discover server status via cat images (e.g., 404 Cat Not Found).
- **I'm Bored**: Suggests random activities when you don't know what to do.
- **Coin Flip**: A rigged coin toss that sometimes loses the coin or defies the laws of physics.

### ⚠️ Danger Zone
- **THE Red Button**: It explicitly says "DO NOT PUSH". If you push it... it activates the **Meltdown** protocol (CSS earthquake, color inversion, system panic logs, and threats to share personal data).

## 🕵️ Easter Eggs & Hidden Assets

Hidden in the root of the project are special audio files, ready to be used as "motivation" for users (or to scare crawlers). These are screams from a famous Italian teleshopping seller (Wanna Marchi) yelling insults at people to buy slimming products:

* `guerra_al_lardo.mp3` ("War on Lard") - For when the code is too heavy.
* `sei_aumentata_40_kili.mp3` ("You gained 40 kilos") - Honest feedback on `node_modules` size.
* `lardosa_grassa.mp3` ("Lardy fatty") - Digital body shaming.
* `vergogna.mp3` ("Shame") - To play when a test fails.

> *Note: These files are blocked in `robots.txt` to prevent Google from indexing the screaming*.
